# GPSDataCollector

## About

Our goal is to establish a vendor-neutral solution to the problem of tracking sportsmen when they are participating in their events. It's either for the safety or to solve dispute on the winner/loser of a sport, the use of it is only dependent on the end user implementing the location-tracking microservice. 
The UI our application provided will be to cater a sport or two depending on the time we have and we will drill down into the sport to illustrate the complete potential of the location tracking service.

This is the client side app that is used for sending the required location data to the backend of the application.
This repository consist of both the iOS and watchOS application.

### This application has been written purely in swift.

## 3rd party libraries used in this application are:
1) Alamofire
2) SwiftJSON

## Methods to run the application:
Download the zip file. Xcode is required to open the project and run it. Change the schema to RiderTrackWatchApp and make sure both the iOS and watchOS simulators are selected. Finally run the project.
